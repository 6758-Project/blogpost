# Warmup
## Q1: Goalie Save Percentage
In this exercise, NHL goalies from the 2017-2018 season were ranked using a simple save percentage metric (shots saved / all shots).

This naive methodology proved vulnerable to small sample sizes. The top and bottom goalies by this metric [below] all played sparingly, with insufficient shots faced to allow the Law of Large Numbers to take effect.

Our simple solution to this problem was to discard all goalies who saw less than 300 minutes (i.e. 5 full 60-minute games) of action [see subsection Q2].

## Q2
The following ranking is created after removing players with less than 300 minutes of game time. It shows the top 20 goaltenders with the highest save percentage of the 2017-2018 season.

## Q3: Assessing Goaltender Performance

Another common metric for assessing goaltender performance is the goal against average (GAA), which is the mean of goals allowed per game. However, GAA is even "coarser" than naive save percentage because it does not account for the number of "trials" (i.e. shots faced), and scales by games played instead of total minutes.

We can improve on GAA and SV% by recognizing that hockey is a competitive team sport, and therefore the strength of both the goalie's teammates and opposition will affect his or her performance. Total shots faced is a weak (inverse) proxy for the goalie's team strength which can be approved by adjusting for _where_ the faced shots were taken. Teams with good defense will force their opponents to take shots from less dangerous areas of the ice, which would boost their goalie's naive SV%. However, we can adjust for this by weighting each shot faced according its on-ice location's average frequency across the league as a whole. These frequencies could be estimated through standard density estimation techniques.

Similarly, we can account for opponent quality by weighting each goalie's shots and goals-against according to the rate at which the opposing shot taker converted similar shots against other goalies. This weighting could also be achieved by standard density estimation techniques.




# Data Acquisition Tutorial

The [NHL Stats API](http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/) is a rich source of historical hockey data.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to download gameplay data from the NHL API programmatically.

## Understand
The NHL gameplay data is organized primarily by the starting year of each season (2016, 2017, etc.), then subseason (preseason, regular season, playoffs, and all-star games).

This information is combined with game-level enumeration conventions to assigned each game a unique ID. For more detail on how numeric codes map to the organization of the API, see the [unofficial NHL Stats API documentation](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#game-ids).


## Implement
We begin by writing a simple function to get a `game_url` from a `game_id` as determined by the API's naming conventions:

```python
def get_game_url(game_id: str):
    """ Returns an NHL stats API URL based on an NHL GAME_ID """
    return f"https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/{game_id}/feed/live/"
```

We then write a function which retrieves data from an API url for a list of game IDs. Since the NHL API is HTTP-based, we will use python's standard `requests` library:

```python
def download_games(game_ids: List, datadir: os.PathLike):
    """ Downloads data for a set of NHL Game IDs.

        Applies a data directory structure of year/type/ID.json
        Logs warnings if no data associated with game_id.
    """
    for game_id in game_ids:
        response = requests.get(get_game_url(game_id))

        if response.status_code == 404:
            pass  # handle errors as desired, but likely corresponds to a playoff game that wasn't necessary
        else:
            subseason = "regular" if game_id[4:6] == "02" \
                          else "postseason" if game_id[4:6] == "03" \
                          else None
            if not subseason:
                raise ValueError(f"{game_id[4:6]} is not a recognized subseason code")

            path_to_datafile = os.path.join(datadir, game_id[:4], subseason, f"{game_id}.json")
            with open(path_to_datafile, "wb") as f:
                f.write(response.content)
```

Finally, we write a function to construct actual game ids for seasons of interest:

```python
def generate_regular_season_game_ids(season: int):
    """ For an NHL season starting in year SEASON, return all regular season game IDs.
    """
    regular_season_games = 1230 if season <= 2016 else 1271

    regular_game_ids = []
    for game_num in range(1, regular_season_games+1):
        game_num_padded = str(game_num).zfill(4)
        regular_game_id = str(season) + "02" + game_num_padded
        regular_game_ids.append(regular_game_id)

    return regular_game_ids
```

Implementation of `generate_postseason_game_ids` is left as an exercise.

Putting things together, we call our functions in a script:

```python
for season in seasons:
    requested_game_ids = []
    requested_game_ids.extend(generate_regular_season_game_ids(season))
    requested_game_ids.extend(generate_postseason_game_ids(season))

    download_games(requested_game_ids, args.datadir)
```

# Tidy Data

In order to gain insights from the raw NHL data that was downloaded using the preceding tutorial, we will explain how can we get a tidy version of the events from the raw data.

In this milestone, we are interested in two types of events in any gameplay: `SHOT` and `GOAL`.


## Final Output
In the following figure we see a dataframe where we extracted 28 pieces of information about each gameplay event (a full description of the 28 columns is discussed in the next section):

![Tidy dataframe of the NHL gameplay data](/Images/m1-cleaned-data.png)


## Gameplay Event Data

We save the following information for each gameplay event:

```python
event_entry = {
                "id": event_id,
                "event_index": event_index,
                "game_id": game_id,
                "home_team": home_team,
                "away_team": away_team,
                "type": event_type_id,
                "secondary_type": event_secondary_type,
                "description": event_desc,
                "code": event_code,
                "period": period_num,
                "period_type": period_type,
                "time": event_time,
                "time_remaining": event_time_remaining,
                "date": event_date,
                "goals_home": event_goals_home,
                "goals_away": event_goals_away,
                "shooter_team_id": shooter_team_id,
                "shooter_team_name": shooter_team_name,
                "shooter_team_code": shooter_team_code,
                "shooter_name": shooter_name,
                "shooter_id": shooter_id,
                "goalie_name": goalie_name,
                "goalie_id": goalie_id,
                "is_empty_net": empty_net,
                "is_winning_goal": game_winning_goal,
                "strength_name": strength_name,
                "strength_code": strength_code,
                "coordinate_x": coord_x,
                "coordinate_y": coord_y,
            }
```
where `code` means the team's code and `type` is for the event type (shot or goal).

## Q2: Extracting Team Strength Information
Noting that team strength is determined by penalties of established duration (and potential cancellation by goals), we can use the gametime metadata associated with each event to infer each team's strength at any point in a game.

## Q3: Other Features
Beside extracting the players strength that was discussed in the previous section, we can calculated other domain-specific aspects such as whether or not a shot or goal occurred off a rebound, a rush, or a faceoff.

### Rebound
We could detect rebounds by identifying shots that occur within a few seconds of another shot by the same team, with no events in between.

### Shot of the rush
Another dangerous event in hockey are rushes, i.e. changes in puck possession between teams which result in multiple players be a step or more ahead of opposing defenders.

We can detect shots generated off the rush by looking for in-game events occurring outside of the shooting team's offensive zone (i.e. `coordinate_x <=25`) a few seconds prior to the shot, with some time gradation likely necessary for the speed of the puck carrier(s) implied by the difference between the triggering event and the shot.

By "in-game events," we mean faceoffs, takeaways, giveaways, hits, and shots by the opposing team (including misses and blocks). Takeaways and giveaways may be particularly dangerous situations, so a one-hot encoding of rush-triggering event types may be merited instead of a single indicator feature.

### Offensive Zone Faceoffs
Another potential feature is whether or not a shot/goal occurred immediately after a faceoff.

Teams frequently attempt coordinated offensive attacks immediately after breaks in gameplay, which resumes with a faceoff. These coordinated "set plays" can be especially successful for the offending team, and us when we are attempting to understand high-probability goal scenarios.




# Simple Visualization

## Q1: Shot distributions by type, 2018 season

![Shot distributions by type, 2018 season](/Images/shot-distribution-by-type.png)

|Shot Type |Goals|Shots (excluding Goals) |Goal Percentage|
|:------------:|:--:|:---:|:---:|
|Tip-In        |761 |3547 |0.177|
|Deflected     |263 |1286 |0.170|
|Backhand      |741 |5803 |0.113|
|Snap Shot     |1155|10406|0.100|
|Wrist Shot    |3854|39999|0.089|
|Wrap-around   |60  |824  |0.068|
|Slap Shot     |768 |10955|0.066|


Shot-level data from the 2018-19 season makes it clear that tips (intentional redirections of one player's shot by another player) and deflections (unintentional redirections) are very dangerous situations for defending teams.

As expected, snap and wrist shots are the most common shot types. This makes sense because both types can be easily disguised from defending goaltenders: snap shots require no prior adjustment of the player's hold on the stick, while wrist shots look similar to passes until the moment they are released.


## Q2: Goal percentage by distance

![Goal percentage by distance, 2018-2020](/Images/goal-percentage-by-distance.png)
_Note:  Excludes shootouts, empty net situations, and shots from outside the offensive zone_

Goal percentages by distance from the net for recent seasons show that shots taken close to the net convert to goals at a consistently higher rate, from almost 40% within 5 feet of the net to roughly 2.5% near the blueline at 70 feet.

There is no significant variations between seasons.

It is worth cautioning that this association is highly unlikely to be causal -- shots taken close to the net are probably consequences of superior talent and planning (or just luck) on the side of the offensive team.


## Q3: Goal percentage by shot type

![Goal percentage by shot type, 2018-2020](/Images/goal-percentage-by-shot-type.png)
_Note: Excludes shootouts, empty net situations, and shots from outside the offensive zone_

Breaking down goal percentages by shot type, we see that our conclusion about the power of tip-ins and deflections is moderated by their prevalance at extremely short distances.

Instead, close-range slap shots convert at consistently higher rates than than snap and wrist shots taken at similar distances.

Again, these statistical associations do not imply causality. For example, while slap shots are more dangerous than snap shots, it is not always possible for a player to setup for a slap shot. Therefore, assuming teams are attempting to maximize expected goals per game, taking many snap shots may actually be preferable to setting up relatively fewer slap shots.

The comments above are reinforced by a breakdown of shot attempts by type over distance:

![Shot attempts by distance and type, 2018-2020](/Images/shot-attempts-by-type.png)
_Note: Excludes shootouts, empty net situations, and shots from outside the offensive zone_
