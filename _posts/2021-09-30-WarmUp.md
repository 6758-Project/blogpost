## Question 1 

In this exercise, the goaltender data of 2017-2018 was retrieved and ranked using the save percentage. It was discovered that there is one player with a save percentage value of null. In the subsequence exercises, the null value was replaced with 0. 

The figure below shows the beginning and the endding of the ranked dataframe. Ranking using the save percentage reveals that the top ranking players and the worst ranking players are all players who have only played a small number of games. Due to the low number of shots they faced, their save percentage would either be very high or very low.

This would not be a proper representation of the goalie's ability since there is insufficient performance data available. One method to remove this anomaly from the ranking is to remove the players who have less than 300 minutes of game time. Alternatively, the save percentage can be adjusted using other parameters that would represent or account for the low number of performance data avaliable.

## Question 2

The following ranking is created after removing players with less than 300 minutes of game time. It shows the top 20 goaltenders with the highest save percentage of the 2017-2018 season.

## Question 3

A similar parameter derived to account for the low number of games played is the goal against average, which is the number the number of goals divided by the number of games played. However, this does not take into consideration the number of shots the goalie may have faced. Another interesting parameter in the dataset is the goal saved above average (GSAA). This parameter removes the goalies who faced too little shots and compare individual performance against the average performance of all the goalies. As a result, this approach would provide a more meaningful relational comparison. However, since hockey is a competitive team sport, many other parameters would affect the perceived performance of the goaltender. Such parameters can include, the performance of the teammates, the strength of the different opponents, potential injuries, the number of players on the ice, and etc. If these parameters can be recorded and measured accurately, a ranking that can more accurately reflects the true performance of the goalie may be generated.
