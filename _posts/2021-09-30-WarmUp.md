## Question 1 

In this exercise, the goaltender data of 2017-2018 was retrieved and ranked using the save percentage. It was discovered that there is one player with a save percentage value of null. In the subsequent exercises, the null value was replaced with 0. 

Ranking NHL goalies using a naive save percentage metric (shots saved / all shots) is a methodology vulnerable to small sample sizes. The top and bottom goalies by this metric (shown below) have all played sparingly, with insufficient shots faced to allow the Law of Large Numbers to take effect.

Our simple solution to this problem was to discard all goalies who saw less than 300 minutes (i.e. 5 full 60-minute games) of action.

## Question 2

The following ranking is created after removing players with less than 300 minutes of game time. It shows the top 20 goaltenders with the highest save percentage of the 2017-2018 season.

## Question 3

A similar metric that can be used to address the low number of games played indirectly is the goal against average, which is the mean of goals allowed per game by a goaltender/goalkeeper. However, this does not take into consideration the number of shots the goalie may have faced. Another interesting metric in the dataset is the goal saved above average (GSAA). This metric removes the goalies who faced too little shots and compare individual performance against the average performance of all the goalies. As a result, this approach would provide a more meaningful relational comparison. 


Nevertheless, it is recongized that hockey is a competitive team sport and many other metrics can affect the perceived performance of the goaltender. Such metrics can include, the performance of the teammates, the strength of different opponents, potential injuries, the number of players on the ice, and etc. If these metrics can be recorded and measured accurately, a more appropriate ranking of the true performance of the goalies may be generated.
