title: Tidy up the NHL Game Data 
---

In order to gain insights from the raw NHL data that was downloaded using [this tutorial]({% post_url 2021-10-01-downloading-nhl-data %}), we will explain how can we get a tidy version of the events from the raw data.

In this milestone, we are interested in two types of events in any gameplay: `SHOT` and `GOAL`.

## Final Output
In the following figure we see a dataframe where we extracted 28 pieces of inforamtion about each gameplay event (a full description of the 28 columns is discussed in the next section):

## Gameplay Event Data

We save the following information for each gameplay event:


```python
event_entry = {
                "id": event_id,
                "event_index": event_index,
                "game_id": game_id,
                "home_team": home_team,
                "away_team": away_team,
                "type": event_type_id,
                "secondary_type": event_secondary_type,
                "description": event_desc,
                "code": event_code,
                "period": period_num,
                "period_type": period_type,
                "time": event_time,
                "time_remaining": event_time_remaining,
                "date": event_date,
                "goals_home": event_goals_home,
                "goals_away": event_goals_away,
                "shooter_team_id": shooter_team_id,
                "shooter_team_name": shooter_team_name,
                "shooter_team_code": shooter_team_code,
                "shooter_name": shooter_name,
                "shooter_id": shooter_id,
                "goalie_name": goalie_name,
                "goalie_id": goalie_id,
                "is_empty_net": empty_net,
                "is_winning_goal": game_winning_goal,
                "strength_name": strength_name,
                "strength_code": strength_code,
                "coordinate_x": coord_x,
                "coordinate_y": coord_y,
            }
```
where `code` means the team's code and `type` is for the event type (shot or goal).

## Extract Strength Information
The strength of the game is recoreded if the event is `GOAL` only and the players strength information does not exist in both.

### How?
Since all the events are recorded by the time of happening, we can use occurrences of `Penalty` and other events to track the game strength and record it for each event. For the players strength (i.e. 5 on 4 or 5 on 5) a similar method is valid to track what is the players strength for each team at any event.

## More Information
Beside extracting the players strength that was discussed in the previous section we can extract other attributes like:

### Shot of the rush:
